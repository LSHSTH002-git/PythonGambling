# ES Games Gambling Machine - Proof of Concept

Welcome to the ES Games Gambling Machine's Proof of Concept repository. In this project, we'll be implementing a gambling game that challenges users to guess a number. This project prioritizes responsible gaming and aims to provide an enjoyable experience without promoting reckless gambling behavior.

## Project Overview

In this two-week project, we will be implementing the logic and user feedback systems for ES Games's new gambling machine. The primary goal is to create a game where users can guess a number and receive immediate feedback through visual and auditory cues.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/es-games-gambling-machine.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd es-games-gambling-machine
   ```

3. Install any necessary dependencies (if required):
   ```
   # Example command
   npm install
   ```

4. Start implementing the logic and user feedback systems according to the provided requirements.

## Project Details

### Game Mechanics

Users will be prompted to guess a number within a specified range. The game will provide visual and auditory cues to indicate their proximity to the correct answer. The closer the guess, the faster the LEDs will blink, and the louder the buzzer will ring.

### Responsible Gaming

We acknowledge the importance of responsible gaming and prioritize user experience over reckless gambling. Our implementation seeks to provide an entertaining and engaging experience while discouraging unhealthy gambling habits.

## Next Steps

As part of the two-week timeframe, the following tasks should be completed:

- Implement the logic for number guessing and feedback mechanisms.
- Integrate LED blinking and buzzer ringing based on user guesses.
- Test the implementation on the target hardware (Raspberry Pi 0).
